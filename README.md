# GreenGeck
Contains some Unity c# templates that I got tired of writing over and over again. All of those scripts have been tested, they do what they are supposed to, but probably not the most efficient way.
All the c++, js & python stuff is my university work.
If you find something useful, feel free to use and adopt it. 
The code is quite messy if you try to rewrite it tho.
